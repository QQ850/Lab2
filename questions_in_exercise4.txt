My understanding of the best practiuces oto use dynamic memory allocation in C++:

1. *p is a pointer, p refers to the memory location.

2. When pointer is used as a parameter, should have const. like "int* const data". 

3. assume int arr = new int[3] {1, 2, 3};
          int *ip = arr = &arr[0];
          and the value of *(ip + i) is arr[i];
          
4.int *a = new int; --> paired with delete a;
  int *a = new int[size]; --> paired with delete[] a;
